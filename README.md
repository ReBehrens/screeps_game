# Screeps Scripts

## What is Screeps?

**Screeps** is an MMO real-time strategy game designed for programmers.
The name stands for "Scripting Creeps," because the primary focus of the game is controlling units (called Creeps) through programming.
Players write JavaScript code to manage resource gathering, building structures, and fighting against other players.
The code is executed in real-time, meaning your scripts run even when you are offline, determining how efficiently your Creeps perform their tasks.
